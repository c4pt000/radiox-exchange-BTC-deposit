withdrawfunds - send RADC received during a trade to an external RADC wallet and close trade

SYNOPSIS
--------
withdrawfunds
		--trade-id=<trade-id>
		--address=<btc-address>
		[--memo=<"memo">]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A RADC buyer completes the final step in the trade protocol by sending received RADC to
an external RADC wallet.

The alternative way to close out the trade is to keep the received RADC in the Bisq wallet
with the closetrade command.

The buyer needs to complete the trade protocol using the closetrade or withdrawfunds command.
This step may not seem necessary from the buyer's perspective, but it is necessary for correct
transition of a trade's state to CLOSED, within the Bisq server.

OPTIONS
-------
--trade-id
		The ID of the trade (the full offer-id).

--address
		The destination btc address for the btc transaction.

--memo
		An optional memo to be saved with the btc transaction.
		A multi-word memo must be enclosed in double quotes.

EXAMPLES
--------
A RADC seller has informed the buyer that fiat payment has been received for trade with ID
83e8b2e2-51b6-4f39-a748-3ebd29c22aea, and locked RADC has been released to the buyer.
The RADC buyer closes out the trade by sending the received RADC to an external RADC wallet:
$ ./bisq-cli --password=xyz --port=9998 withdrawfunds --trade-id=83e8b2e2-51b6-4f39-a748-3ebd29c22aea \
    --address=2N5J6MyjAsWnashimGiNwoRzUXThsQzRmbv               (bitcoin regtest address)
